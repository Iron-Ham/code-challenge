# Weekly VTS Coding Challenge

Each directory has a README.md describing the challenge. Solutions are places inside the directory in format solution_<initals>.<ext>

Rules:
1. No Cheating, i.e., no peeking at implemented solutions on here or on the web.
2. All languages are welcome
3. Your solution must pass the base test cases I provide
4. In a comment within your solution file, you must correctly describe your solutions runtime and memory in big o notation
