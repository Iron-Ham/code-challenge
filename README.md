# Weekly VTS Coding Challenge

Each directory has a README.md describing the challenge. Solutions are places inside the directory in format `solution_<initals>.<ext>`

Rules:

* No cheating, i.e., no peeking at implemented solutions on here or on the web.
* All languages are welcome.
* Your solution must pass the base test cases I provide.
* In a comment within your solution file, you must describe your solutions runtime and memory in big o notation.
