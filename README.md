# Weekly VTS Coding Challenge

Each directory has a README.md describing the challenge. Solutions are placed inside the directory in format `solution_<initals>.<ext>`.

## Testing

Run `./test` with the challengeâ€™s test case file and your executable. Your executable must accept input via STDIN and output via STDOUT.

## Rules

Rules:

* No cheating, i.e., no peeking at implemented solutions on here or on the web.
* All languages are welcome.
* Your solution must pass the base test cases I provide.
* In a comment within your solution file, you must describe your solutions runtime and memory in big o notation.
* Post your solutions directly to this git repo.

We'll talk about the solutions during the coding-challenge brownbag.
