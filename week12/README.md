# Maximum Gap

Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Try to solve it in linear time/space.

Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.

## Examples

### Example 1

#### Input

[ 3, 2, 6, 1, 3 ]

#### Output

3

#### Reason
Between 6 and 3 there is the greatest difference

### Example 2

#### Input

[ 12, 18, 45, 23, 76, 11 ]

#### Output

31

#### Reason
Between 76 and 45 is the greatest difference
