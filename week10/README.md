# Lost in Translation

Write a function that outputs all of the words whose keystrokes generate valid words on
both a qwerty and dvorak keyboard. You may read your english dictionary from the `words` file
provided here.

Alternatively, you can find the `words` file in `/usr/share/dict/words`

### Example:

On a qwerty keyboard, the key strokes for `hot` correspond to `dry` on a dvorak keyboard
