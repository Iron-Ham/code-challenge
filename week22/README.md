# It's So Dark

Given you have `N` lights, write these two methods:

(you can use any data structures you want anywhere, as long as it abides by the API specified below)

```javascript

/**
 * Whether or not light at index `index` is on
 *
 * @param {number} index index of light to search for
 * @returns {boolean} whether or not light at `index` is on
 */
function isOn(index) {}

/**
 * Toggles all lights from [i, j]
 *
 * @param {number} i start index of toggling range (inclusive)
 * @param {number} j end index of toggling range (inclusive)
 * @returns {void}
 */
function toggle(i, j) {}

```
