# The Holy Trinity

Given a list of elements of mostly duplicates, find the only element that does not have any duplicates.
All elements that are duplicated come in pairs (however, not necessarily next to each other).

To be considered for the grand prize:
- Each person must submit three solutions
- Each solution must either be in a different language or use a different implementation

The winner will be whoever has the best combination of LOC, time complexity, and memory complexity.

## Example 1:

### Input

```
3 5 6 3 2 2 8 6
```

### Output

```
8
```

## Example 2:

### Input

```
1 4 2 3 1 5 2 4
```

### Output

```
5
```
