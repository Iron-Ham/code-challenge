### Week 3 Coding Challenge - Reverse Words in string

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.

For example
``` Javascript
solution("the sky is blue")
=> "blue is sky the"
```

Bonus: Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
