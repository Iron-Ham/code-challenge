# Description

Write a function that determines whether or not a binary tree is balanced. A binary tree is considered balanced if the difference in height of each nodes left and right subtree is never more than 1

# Hint

Pay attention to your runtime complexity. There are two slightly different solutions that greatly affect the runtime complexity of your code.

# Sample Input (in order of insertion):

`[2, 3, 7, 8, 1, 9, 25, 29, 22, 33, 8, 7]` # Not Balanced

`[8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14, 13]`           # Balanced
