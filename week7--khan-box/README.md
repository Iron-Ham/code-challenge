# Khan Box

Given an N x N matrix, write a function that returns the maximum
number of rows that can be made into one uniform value given that
the only way you can manipulate the matrix is by taking a column
and flipping the bit of each element in that column. You may "flip"
as many columns as you wish.


Examples:

Input:
```
4 
0 1 1 0 
1 1 0 0 
1 0 0 1 
1 0 1 1
```

Output:
```
2
```

Input:
```
3
1 1 0
0 1 1
0 1 0
```

Output:
```
1
```
